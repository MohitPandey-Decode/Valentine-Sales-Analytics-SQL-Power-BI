# 💘 From Raw Data to Revenue Strategy: Valentine Sales Analytics

## 🧩 Business Challenge

A retail company running Valentine campaigns lacked clarity on:

- Which customers were truly profitable
- Which product categories needed optimization
- Why revenue growth was inconsistent across segments

Without structured analysis, marketing spend was inefficient.

I built a full data pipeline:

1. Designed a structured MySQL database
2. Cleaned and transformed 670 sales transactions
3. Performed revenue & satisfaction segmentation analysis
4. Built an interactive Power BI dashboard for decision-makers

## 📈 Strategic Recommendations

To improve profitability:

- Focus premium marketing on high-spending relationship segments
